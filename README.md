TODO
----
- it was possible to eat diamonds that are not getting added to the score. Needs thorough playtesting.
- touch up the tileset to real 16x16 graphics? starting with diamonds and boulders then Rockford then the rest
- selectable tilesets?  also add the real c64 retro tileset with adjustable palette?
- add ability to load BDCFF caves from disk files.
- high score table, persistent on disk
- better title tune (Crisps?)
- better sound effects for the random sounds (Use random tones from a scale rather than totally random frequencies?)
- tweak the controls to also register button presses outside of cavescan?
- fix the remaining TODO's in the code
